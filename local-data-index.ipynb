      "When using Northwind Health Plus, you may be responsible for a copayment (or copay) for \n",
      "certain services. A copayment is a fixed amount that you are expected to pay for a service. \n",
      "The amount of the copayment varies based on the type of service received, whether the \n",
      "service is rendered by an in -network or out -of-network provider, and other factors.  \n",
      "In-Network Copays:  \n",
      "For in -network services, copayments are generally lower than for out -of-network services. \n",
      "The copayment for prima ry care visits is typically around $20, while specialist visits have a \n",
      "copayment of around $50. For in -network emergency services, the copayment is typically \n",
      "around $100. In addition, for in -network preventive care services, there is typically no \n",

      "Out-of-Network Copays:  \n",
      "For out -of-network services, copayments are typically higher than for in -network services. \n",
      "The copayment for primary care visits is typically around $50, while specialist visits have a \n",
      "copayment of around $75. For out -of-network emergency services, the copayment is \n",
      "typically around $150. Please note that Northwind Health Plus will only cover a portion of \n",
      "out-of-network services, and you may be responsible for the remaining balance.  \n",
      "Exceptions:  \n",
      "There are a few exceptions to the c opayment amounts listed above. For example, for mental \n",

      "around $30 and the copayment for out -of-network services is typically around $60. In \n",

      "For example, if the allowed amount for a service is $100 and your coinsurance is 20%, you \n",
