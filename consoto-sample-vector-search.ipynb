The calendar year deductible is the same for \\n\\nall members of the plan and is reset each year on the plan's renewal date.  \\n\\nFor In-Network Services: The calendar year deductible for in-network services is $1,500 for \\n\\nindividuals and $3,000 for families. This means that you must pay the full cost of all covered \\n\\nservices until you have paid a total of $1,500 for an individual and $3,000 for a family.

This means that \\n\\nafter you have met your deductible, you will be responsible for a certain percentage of the \\n\\ncosts for covered services. The coinsurance rate is usually a percentage of the allowed \\n\\namount for a service, and it is your responsibility to pay this amount.  \\n\\nFor example, if the allowed amount for a service is $100 and your coinsurance is 20%, you \\n\\nare responsible for paying $20 (20% of $100).

It includes both the amount that the plan pays and any \\n\\namount that the insured is responsible for paying. This total Allowed Amount is usually a \\n\\npercentage of the provider's charge. In some cases, the Allowed Amount may be a fixed \\n\\namount. \\n\\nIn general, the Allowed Amount is the lesser of the provider's charge, the plan's Allowed \\n\\nAmount, and the copayment amount. This means that the insured may be responsible for \\n\\npaying the difference between the provider's charge and the Allowed Amount. \\n\\n\\n\\nIt is important to remember that the Allowed Amount may not cover the entire cost of a \\n\\nservice. Therefore, the insured may be responsible for paying any remaining balance, even if \\n\\nit is more than the Allowed Amount. \\n\\nExceptions:  \\n\\nIn some cases, a service may not have an Allowed Amount or the Allowed Amount may be \\n\\nhigher than the provider's charge. This may occur when the service is considered to be a \\n\\nnon-covered service or when the service is not a usual or customary service. In these cases, \\n\\nthe insured will be responsible for paying the entire cost of the service.\",\n",
